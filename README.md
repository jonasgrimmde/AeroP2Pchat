# Aero P2P Chat

Aero P2P Chat is a compact Electron desktop chat client with a Frutiger Aero inspired interface. It uses PeerJS/WebRTC data connections so chat messages travel peer-to-peer after both users are connected.

## Features

- Compact friends-list style layout
- Peer ID based direct chat
- Copy your own Peer ID
- Connect to another peer by entering their Peer ID
- Native desktop builds for Windows and Linux
- Terminal commands for updates, status, opening, and uninstalling

## How It Works

1. Start Aero P2P Chat.
2. Copy your Peer ID and send it to your chat partner.
3. Your chat partner pastes that ID into the connect field.
4. Once connected, both sides can send messages directly.

PeerJS is used for signaling. That means you do not need to run your own server, but the app still needs PeerJS signaling to discover and connect peers. The actual chat data is sent over WebRTC peer-to-peer.
